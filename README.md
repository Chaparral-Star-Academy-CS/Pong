This is a basic pong game made with pygame. The main objective is to score points on the enemy team(the computer) by hitting the ball with your paddle and trying to get the ball past their paddle. You also have to try to prevent the ball getting past your paddle. 
A point is scored for you if they hit the ball past the enemy paddle and a point is scored for the enemy if they hit the ball past your padddle. 
The ball goes faster on each hit and your paddle gets smaller each time it is hit. 
When the enemy scores three points on you, your score is recorded and the top ten scores are shown, or as many as there are, if there are less than ten.
